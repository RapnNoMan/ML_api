Behavioural Authentication, an Overview\nBehavioural authentication is a subset of biometric\nauthentication which uses measurable properties of a person’s\nactions to identify the person. All behavioural biometric\nsystems work in a similar manner: by analysing the current\nuser actions create a model of individual user behaviour and\nthen use this model to predict the future user behaviour.\nAlthough behavioural biometrics generally introduces less\naccuracy levels (error rates) than the physical biometrics, they\nhave some advantages over physical methods:\n As discussed in the introduction, behavioural\nmethods are more resistive against spoofing attacks.\n Data gathering process is often unnoticeable by the\nuser.\n They are often less expensive and require no\nspecialized hardware.\nMost of the current research in behavioural biometrics\nconcentrates on very low level user behaviour such as\nkeystroke dynamics and mouse movements. Although these\ntraits are accurate, they reveal user behaviour directly related\nto physical abilities of the human and ignore higher level\nintentional behaviours, which may describe identity of the\nperson more successfully [ 17 ].\nC.
